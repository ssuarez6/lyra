*********FOR INTERPOLATION METHODS**********
You need to send an array of the x's points and the y's points
in different request variables. And also you need to send the 
value you need to evaluate by interpoling.

For example, a request would be:

xs: [1,2,3,4],
ys: [7,8,9,10],
value: 2.5
method: 'lagrange' or 'neville' or 'newton' ===> LOWERCASE

The response will be simply a message with the value interpolated
and, in newton and lagrande, the interpolating polynomial.
All togther in a string.
